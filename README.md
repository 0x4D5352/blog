# Mussar's Blog

This holds all my blogs, rendered to the web as HTML and referenced in-repo as Obsidian-style Markdown. 

The webserver is a simple Go application that serves static pages. If traffic ever exceeds 100 human users in a month, I'll add a comments section.
Until then, it's just a way for me to practice my front end skills.
